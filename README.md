## Abstract
Fluorescence guidance is widely utilized to improve the precision of cancer surgery. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA),
the most widely used fluorophore in glioma surgery, is thought to cause selective accumulation of fluorescent
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in tumor cells. 5-ALA is highly specific for densely tumor-infiltrated tissue but less effective
for visualizing the tumor periphery. To improve clinical detection of PpIX, we developed a microscope to perform
paired stimulated Raman histology (SRH) and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (TPEF) and validated it
in fresh tumor specimens from 115 high-grade glioma patients across four institutions. There was a weak negative
correlation between tissue cellularity and PpIX fluorescence intensity across all imaged specimens (R=-0.22). Semi-
supervised machine learning clustering of TPEF images revealed five distinct patterns of PpIX fluorescence. Spatial
transcriptomic analysis of tissue imaged with the SRH/TPEF microscope demonstrated that myeloid cells
predominate in areas where PpIX accumulates in the intracellular space. Further analysis of external spatially
resolved metabolomics, transcriptomics and RNA sequencing datasets of glioblastoma specimens confirmed that
myeloid cells most avidly accumulate and metabolize PpIX. Our findings encourage reconsideration of the existing
theory of 5-ALA-induced glioma cell fluorescence and demonstrate how 5-ALA and TPEF imaging can provide a
window into the immune microenvironment of human gliomas.
